        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Succulent sausages nestled on a bed of buttery mashed potatoes and drenched in a rich onion gravy, Bangers and Mash has been ranked as Great Britain’s #1 most popular comfort food.   This bangers and mash recipe is the ONLY one you’ll ever need!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 high quality pork sausages (pork is traditional but if you don't eat pork you can use chicken sausages, etc)</li>
            <li>2 pounds Yukon Gold or other medium-starch potato , peeled and cut into large (2 inch) uniform chunks (or boiled whole in skins and peeled while hot)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3/4 to 1 cup hot milk (we recommend whole but you can use 2%)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
            <li>To Make the Mash: Place the potatoes in a pot of water and add the salt. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to a steady simmer and cook for about 15-20 minutes or until they potatoes are just tender when pierced with a knife. Be careful not to over-boil them.<br>horoughly drain the potatoes and place them back in the empty pot set over very low heat just to maintain warmth. If using a ricer or food mill (this creates the most optimal texture), run the potatoes through it now while they're hot. If using a hand masher mash the potatoes while they're hot. (Avoid using an electric mixer or food processor. See blog post for explanation.) Mash the potatoes until fluffy and you've reached the desired degree of smoothness. Be careful not to over-mash or the potatoes will become gluey.<br>Use a spoon to stir in the butter. Once melted stir in the hot milk gradually, allowing time for the potatoes to absorb the liquid after each addition. Add more hot milk as needed to achieve desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>To Prepare the Sausages: While the potatoes are boiling place the sausages in a baking dish with a little oil and roast the sausages for about 10 minutes on each side or until nicely browned. (Alternatively you can fry the sausages but baking them creates an especially nice crispy outer shell with a juicy interior.)</li>
            <li>To serve, place a mound of mashed potatoes on each plate, lay the sausages on the mashed potatoes and top with onion gravy. Peas are a traditional side.</li>
